  By not providing "FindVRPN.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "VRPN", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "VRPN" with any of
  the following names:

    VRPNConfig.cmake
    vrpn-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "VRPN" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "VRPN_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "VRPN"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
