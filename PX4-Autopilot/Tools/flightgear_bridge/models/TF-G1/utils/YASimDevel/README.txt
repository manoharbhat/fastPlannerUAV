YASim Development Tools
=======================

YasimDevel is a FlightGear add-on whose purpose is to help YASim aircraft
developers. It can be used to display Canvas windows that show internals like
the mass distribution, position of the center of gravity and forces.

Note: this initial version is not meant for, nor tested with helicopters.
